Our whitepaper  <a href="https://aioti.eu/energy-6g-convergence-a-perspective/"> "Energy-6G Convergence: a Perspective" </a> was recently published. With respect to the <a href="https://6g-twin.eu/"> 6G-TWIN </a> project, we contributed to section on 6G network digital twin and telecommunication infrastructure energy management, where we explain how energy savings can be achieved. We also highlight the challenge of green AI-native networks, as it is important to make all AI/ML pipelines energy-aware and not to waste energy on unnecessarily complex models.
