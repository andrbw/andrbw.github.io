The third General Assembly of 6G-TWIN took place at Politecnico di Bari, Italy on 31st March and 1st April. The goal of the project is to provide the foundation for the design, implementation and validation of an AI-native architecture for Network Digital Twin aided 6G systems. Among other topics, the path towards implementation of proof of concepts was discussed. A great journey is still ahead!
