The 7th edition of the Faculty of Science Research Day at the University of Antwerp took place on Wednesday, February 5th. This marks the second year I've had the privilege of helping organize this remarkable event, which brings together so many brilliant minds from various departments within the faculty. Some highlights include over 150 participants, more than 40 scientific posters, 4 outstanding demos, and a diverse and engaging program. I’m already looking forward to next year’s edition!
