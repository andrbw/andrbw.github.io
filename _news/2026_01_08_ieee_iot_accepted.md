Our paper "RF-Zero-Wire: Design and Analysis of Multi-Hop Low-Latency Symbol-Synchronous RF Communication" has been accepted for publication in IEEE Internet of Things Journal! This research is a result of a very fruitful collaboration with our colleagues from KU Leuven, who gave birth to the original Zero-Wire based on optical signals. Special shout out goes to Xinlei Liu, 3rd year Ph.D. student in our group.

We propose a new RF communication design based on symbol-synchronous communication, which guarantees low delay even in case of multiple hops between the source and the destination (or multiple destinations). Want to find out how we fought interference and carrier frequency offset - read in our new paper!
