First edition of ICNS3 conference, formely known as ns-3 Workshop, took place on August 19-21, 2025 in Osaka, Japan. I has been working with ns-3 ever since I started my career in wireless networks research, and it was a great pleasure to meet these legendary people who maintain the simulator throughout so many years. It was an honor to present our paper introducing Uplink OFDMA Random Access (UORA) implementation in Wi-Fi module. The implementation is open and can be found <a href="https://github.com/imec-idlab/WiFi_UORA_ns3"> here </a>. Kudos to Douglas Agbeve, PhD student in our group, who played the leading role in this work.
