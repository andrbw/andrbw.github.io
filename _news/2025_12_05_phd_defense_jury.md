I was honored to serve as a member of examination board for Ph.D. defense of Dr. Thijs Havinga on topic "Flexible and Real-Time Interference Mitigation Techniques for Reliable Wireless Communication Using Software-Defined Radio". Ph.D. defense is of course a special moment for any Ph.D. candidate, but this one was also special for me, as it was my first time on the other side. I strongly believe that it is important to take this role very seriously and assess every aspect of the thesis as thouroughly as ones expertise allows. We all know that theses are almost always based on research that went through peer-review, but the defense is still a challenge, as there is always an angle from which no one has looked at the work done. With this particular thesis, I was impressed by the quantity and quality of Thijs's achievements, this was very enjoyable to assess his work. I look forward to future opportunities!
